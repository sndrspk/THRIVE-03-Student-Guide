# Introduction

This course will introduce you to entrepreneurship and design thinking. You will be grouped in teams, and together with your team, you will solve a problem by a client.

The course is divided into eight modules. Each of them comes with a syllabus chapter, providing you with with background information, and with links to additional materials \(web articles, videos, etc.\). Each module also contains practical assignments that you and your team members will work on.

The course contents are as follows:

1. **Introduction to human-centered design to tackle wicked problems.** This introductory module will introduce you to our methodology. It will teach you the theoretical methodology of human-centered design, which you will use throughout the course. Furthermore, it will explain you what wicked problems are, and how human-centered design can help you to tackle those problems.
2. **Division of labour: team composition and complimentarity.** During this course, you will work in a team. Get to know your team mates, and learn what their strenghts and expertises are. You will also analyse which competenses are absent in your team, and how you will deal with this.
3. **Client introduction and problem briefing.** During the course you will work on a wicked problem, presented by a real client. You will learn to prepare yourself for a briefing to relevant questions, and to make a planning based on a client's briefing.
4. **Finding the problem \(discover and define\).** You will quickly discover that most problems are not what they initially appear to be. Via a process of divergence and convergence, you will analyse the problem and find its root causes to be tackled.
5. **Ethical and sustainable thinking.** You will learn about ethical and sustainable questions, focussed on the creative industries. You will apply the lessons learned on your own problem and potential solutions.
6. **Finding the solution: ideate and prototype.** You will brainstorm and develop multiple solutions through cheap prototypes, test them, and come up with the best solution.
7. **Motivation and perseverence.** You will learn about motivation and perseverance, both on a personal and a team level. Using the theory, you can reflect on the work performed in the past components.
8. **Presentation and implementation.** As the final module, you will work on presentating your solution to the client and implementing it in practice.
