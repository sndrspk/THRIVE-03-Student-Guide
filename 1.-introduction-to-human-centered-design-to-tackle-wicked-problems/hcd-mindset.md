# HCD mindset

Human-centered design requires a certain mindset. Below are eight statements, that we need you and your team mates to subscribe to. Please study them carefully, and discuss them with your team to see if you all agree.

1. **Everybody is creative!** Regardless of whether you have a design background or something that is traditionally seen as less creative, please be aware that everyone is a creative being, even you. We were all creative as kids, so you must still have this skill somewhere in you. Creativity comes in many forms: some are very good at drawing or building things, while others are creative in developing ideas or applying existing concepts in new ways. Find your creativity and utilise it. Build your _creative confidence_.
2. **Learn from the people** for whom you're designing. Don't always look at the world from your own perspective, but empathise with the people you are designing for. New ideas don't come falling from the sky, but they are the result of insights, empathy and understanding of other people.
3. If you don't know an immediate solution to a problem, then **research it!** Solutions often require a certain insight. Don't make too many assumptions, but test your hypotheses.
4. **Show, don't tell!** Words are ambiguous. When you want to discuss or show your idea, find ways to bring your ideas to live. Draw them, make a mock-up, do role-playing, make prototypes!
5. **Embrace ambiguity!** There is no one truth, nor is there only one right solution to a problem. In your journey, you will find conflicting information, and when you talk to people they will tell you many different things. Accept that your end users are not homogeneous, they are personalities with differences. Sometimes it's better to develop a very good solution for a small subset of your user group than a mediocre solution for everyone.
6. **Failure is an opportunity for learning!** There's no harm in failing as long as you fail early and fail cheaply. So, go out and test ideas immediately before developing them. If you fail early and cheaply, it means you learned something and you can close certain doors or pivot your idea to something better.
7. **Ask feedback!** Constantly. From early ideas to final solutions, your end users will indicate you what works and what doesn't. Don't take criticism personally, but welcome it as opportunities for improvement.
8. **Be optimistic!** There is no room for cynicism in human-centered design. Believe there is a solution for your problem somewhere, and keep on working towards it. Progression is always possible.
